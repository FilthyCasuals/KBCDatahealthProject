FAILURE OUTPUT IDEAS

indicate failure reason column more clearly
add column for business rule id
add column to indicate which column is affected
define what to write for the failure reason in UI (set by user)

RULES IDEAS

compare columns relatively
date relative (ie. in last 3 months, today/tomorrow etc...)
presence of a particular character/substring/pattern/mask check
math total comparisons (total/difference between two columns more/less than X value)

data type boolean check
checking for carriage return/new line

multiple tables comparison rules (maybe)

check data based on a business profile (data matches a specific metadata settings)
(ask user if they want to do a check on a metadata (ie. this column is supposed to be integer, want to make it a rule))
